1. Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem

    Insurance Claim Adjusters working for a big claims organization need help with understanding claim details and relevant documents to complete the Claim Adjudication process efficiently

2. Write 1-2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user

    Claims summarization is a major challenge for claim adjusters because they are required to process and interpret large volumes of unstructured information during the claim adjudication process. A single claim file can include adjuster notes, policy documents, incident reports, medical records, legal correspondence, and communications with the insured or third parties. Manually reviewing and extracting the most relevant details from this data is time-consuming and prone to human error, especially when multiple stakeholders and complex coverage scenarios are involved. Without an accurate and concise summary, adjusters risk overlooking critical facts, which can delay resolution, increase leakage, and potentially expose the company to litigation or regulatory issues.

    Moreover, the claim adjudication process often demands that adjusters make decisions quickly while juggling dozens of active claims. Traditional summarization relies on manual note-taking and experience, which is inconsistent and varies between adjusters. This creates bottlenecks in the workflow and reduces overall efficiency. Accurate claims summarization is essential for maintaining consistency, speeding up investigations, and improving collaboration across teams like underwriting, legal, and fraud detection. In short, the inability to quickly generate comprehensive summaries slows down the entire claims lifecycle, impacting both operational costs and customer satisfaction.
